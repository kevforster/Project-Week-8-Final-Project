By using the cohort and survival analysis we found out that the order frequency is lower in a few markets compared to the rest. So therefore we decided to use a recommendation system to be able to make individual recommendations to each customer. We are trying to achieve a higher frequency by using a chatbot that recommends those products to the customer. We are sure that we will be able to be more successful in those countries with this new defined actions."
