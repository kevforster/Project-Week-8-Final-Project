## Project Description
In this project I wanted to do a business analysis of e-commerce store and to define as well as implement new actions. The project started by analysing the data, looking at the cohort and survival analysis by each country

## Hypotheses / Questions
* How can we achieve more profit even though the company is successful?
* Is each market the same or is there a difference of the customer behaviour?
* What are the most valuable customers?
* How can we cluster the customers?
* Which new actions can be defined to improve our business?

## Dataset
* I used the dataset from Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data)

## Cleaning
The process of data cleaning was explained in detail in the final paper. You can find the final paper in the following direction: your-project/notebooks/Final_Paper.ipynb [Link](https://github.com/kevforster/Project-Week-8-Final-Project/blob/master/your-project/notebooks/Final_Paper.ipynb)

## Analysis
* Recency, Frequency, Monetary Analysis
* Unsupervised Learning clustering with KMeans
* Cohort Analysis
* Survival Analysis
* Recommendation System
* Chatbot
The analysis is explained in the final paper in detail. You can find the final paper in the following direction: your-project/notebooks/Final_Paper.ipynb [Link](https://github.com/kevforster/Project-Week-8-Final-Project/blob/master/your-project/notebooks/Final_Paper.ipynb)


## Conclusion
* The survival and cohort analysis showed a different customer behaviour in the different market. Especially the frequency is different in the markets. Although to achieve higher profit we have to try to achieve a higher frequency of the customers. 
* E-commerce has the advantage that you know the order history of each customer. Therefore we can use this history to recommend the perfect products to each customer. 
* A chatbot can be nice support for a more efficient ordering process in e-commerce. Therefore we should make the chatbots as smart as possible to gain a remarkable imporvement for each customer in their ordering process. Unfortunately there are not many smart chatbots implemented yet but I see a lot of potential for the future. 

## Future Work
This project helped me to understand the work of a data scientist in a daily work. Analysing the data and receiving new insight that improve the business is very valuable that every company needs. Although this project also showed me the potential of chatbots and how they work. So I would like to invest some more time on this topic to really understand how we could gain an impact to customers' ordering process by using chatbots. I love this idea. 



## Organization
There are 4 folders:
* images: contains all the screenshots and images that i used for the final paper
* CSV: contains all the csv that i used during my analysis. After each step (cohort analysis, recommendation system etc.) i created a new csv.
* notebooks, I split the notebooks up: 
- Data cleaning (Base_cleaned_data.ipynb), 
- Data analysis with RFM KMeans clustering and cohort analysis (RFM.ipynb), 
- Survival analysis and Recommendation System (Survival_Analysis_Recommendation_system.ipynb)
- Final paper with all the insights and graphs consolidated. This paper does not contain all the codes but all the insights and graphs. (Final_Paper.ipynb)
* Chatbot: for this last chapter of the project I created an own folder. In there you will find the Json for the chatbot and all necessary codes in the file chatbot.ipynb
